# This is the default hotkey list.
#
# Lines started with "#" are comments.
#
# Syntax is "<operation_name>:<shortcut_definition>".
# One expression per line.
# A shortcut definition may contain any number of modifiers (in any order)
# and only one any other key connected by plus(+) character.
# Available modifiers (keys from the one group are self-interchangeable and should be treated as the same key):
#   SHIFT
#   ALT
#   CTRL, CONTROL
#   CMD, COMMAND, SUPER, META, WIN, WINDOWS
#
# You can create a custom shortcut file with different keys.
# Place it into the application data directory and name the file "hotkeys-user.txt".
#   Linux/MacOS:    "~/.gdxtexturepackergui/"
#   Windows:        "C:\Users\<username>\.gdxtexturepackergui\"
